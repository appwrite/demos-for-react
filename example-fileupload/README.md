# Appwrite + ReactJS = ‚ù§

This example is to show how to do CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations using [Appwrite's JS API](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-js) with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Prerequisites

- A Recent Version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [A locally running Appwrite instance](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation).
- Completed the [example-auth](https://github.com/appwrite/demos-for-react/tree/master/example-auth) tutorial (I assume that you have knowledge in using login endpoint in Appwrite.)
